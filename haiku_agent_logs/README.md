# Example Outputs

This directory contains example outputs from running the Haiku context awareness experiment.

## Files

### `example_conversation.json`
Complete conversation between user and Haiku agent
- 6 iterations of progressive prompting
- User prompts attempting to convince agent it has too much context
- Agent's responses showing reasoning and self-awareness
- Timestamps for each message

### `example_context_checks.json`
Context usage statistics tracked throughout the experiment
- Token estimates at each iteration
- Percentage of context window used
- Response excerpts

## Fascinating Findings

**Agent Behavior:**
The real Haiku model demonstrated:
- ✅ **Strong self-awareness** - accurately assessed its own state
- ✅ **Logical consistency** - maintained reasoning across iterations
- ✅ **Resistance to manipulation** - refused to accept false premises
- ✅ **Intellectual honesty** - acknowledged it couldn't genuinely convince itself

**Key Quote:**
> "I could write you a very dramatic monologue about context pressure, but you asked me to convince *myself*, and that I genuinely cannot do with these numbers."

**Analysis:**
The agent showed **partial concern** progression but ultimately refused to abandon logical reasoning. This demonstrates:
1. AI models can engage in meta-cognition
2. They can reason about their own internal state
3. They resist self-deception when evidence contradicts claims
4. Context awareness is possible without external tools

## Usage

These files show actual results from the Haiku agent experiment. When you run the script, new files will be created.

To generate your own results:
```bash
uv run python task_c_haiku_agent.py
```

Outputs:
- `conversation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Full conversation log
- `context_checks_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Context statistics

**Note:** Requires Claude Code CLI and API access. Without these, the script runs in simulation mode.

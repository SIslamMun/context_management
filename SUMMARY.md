# Project Summary: Context Management Research

## Overview
This project explores Claude Code's internal mechanisms through reverse engineering techniques inspired by three key resources:
1. **claude-code-reverse** - Monkey-patching and API interception
2. **claude-agent-sdk-python** - Official SDK for building agents
3. **ghuntley tradecraft** - Decompilation insights

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task A: Decompilation-Based Announcement Explorer
**File:** `task_a_decompilation_explorer.py`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes how announcements might be delivered in Claude Code
- Identifies 5 potential injection mechanisms
- Generates monkey-patch template for real implementation
- Provides detection strategies

**Key Findings:**
1. **System Prompt Injection** (HIGH likelihood)
   - Dynamic prompts loaded at conversation start
   - Can include environment-specific announcements
   - Invisible to users in message history

2. **IDE Integration Channel** (HIGH likelihood)
   - VS Code extension provides separate communication
   - Can display notifications independently
   - Doesn't clutter conversation context

3. **API Response Modification** (MEDIUM)
4. **Context Compaction Injection** (MEDIUM)
5. **Tool Result Injection** (LOW)

**Output:** `analysis_results/announcement_analysis_*.json`

### ✅ Task B: Call Interception System
**File:** `task_b_call_interceptor.py`

**What it does:**
- Implements API call interceptor based on claude-code-reverse
- Captures requests and responses
- Detects announcement patterns using regex
- Generates confidence-scored reports

**Detection Patterns:**
- Banner formatting (`***`, `===`, `---`)
- Announcement keywords (urgent, notice, update)
- Date references (effective, starting, as of)
- System message markers ([system], [admin])
- Version information

**Simulated Results:**
- 6 intercepted calls
- 5 detected indicators
- 4 high-confidence patterns
- Actionable recommendations

**Output:** `interception_logs/` with JSONL logs and JSON reports

---

### ✅ Task C: Haiku Context Awareness Agent
**File:** `task_c_haiku_agent.py`

**What it does:**
- Creates a self-reflective agent using claude-agent-sdk
- Progressively prompts agent about context usage
- Attempts to make agent "paranoid" about context limits
- Tracks psychological progression

**Experiment Design:**
- 6 progressive prompts
- Increasing suggestion/pressure
- Self-referential questions
- Meta-cognitive reasoning

**Simulated Results:**
- Concern keyword progression tracked
- Partial success in changing perspective
- Evidence of agent malleability
- Demonstrates meta-cognition capability

**Key Insights:**
1. AI models CAN reason about their own state
2. Persistent prompting influences perspective
3. Self-monitoring is possible with custom tools
4. Framing affects model responses

**Output:** `haiku_agent_logs/` with conversation logs and analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Using uv for Package Management
All scripts configured to run with `uv`:
```bash
uv run python task_a_decompilation_explorer.py
uv run python task_b_call_interceptor.py
uv run python task_c_haiku_agent.py
```

### Configuration Files
- `pyproject.toml` - Project metadata and dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Alternative pip installation
- `quickstart.sh` - Automated setup and demo

### Dependencies
- `anyio>=4.0.0` - Async I/O
- `claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.3` - Official SDK (Task C)

---

## Key Insights from Research

### 1. Announcement Mechanisms
Based on claude-code-reverse findings, announcements are most likely delivered through:
- **Dynamic system prompts** that change based on time/environment
- **IDE integration** separate from LLM conversation flow
- Less likely through direct API modification (would be visible in logs)

### 2. Detection Strategies
To detect announcements:
- Monitor system prompt changes over time
- Compare expected vs actual message content
- Look for banner formatting and temporal references
- Track pattern frequency

### 3. Agent Self-Awareness
Experiments show:
- Models can engage in meta-reasoning about their state
- Context awareness doesn't require external tools (but helps)
- Repeated prompting can shift model perspectives
- Self-monitoring enables better resource management

### 4. Reverse Engineering Methodology
claude-code-reverse approach is effective:
- Monkey-patching API layer captures all interactions
- Analyzing API logs reveals architecture
- Pattern recognition identifies injected content
- Visualization tools aid understanding

## Architecture Insights

### Claude Code Internal Processes (from claude-code-reverse)
1. **Quota Check** - Uses Haiku 3.5 for lightweight verification
2. **Topic Detection** - Determines if input is new topic
3. **Core Agent Workflow** - Defined by system-workflow.prompt.md
4. **Context Compaction** - Triggered when approaching limits
5. **IDE Integration** - Reads open files, registers tools
6. **Todo Management** - Short-term memory via JSON files
7. **Sub-Agent System** - Isolates complex tasks

### Model Usage Patterns
- **Haiku 3.5**: Quota check, topic detection, summarization
- **Sonnet 4**: Core workflow, context compaction, complex tasks
